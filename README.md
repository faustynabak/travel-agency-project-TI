Travel Agency Website Project:

The travel agency website project consists of a responsive website with an attractive design and intuitive navigation. The website includes a navigation menu that enables easy navigation through different sections of the site. Thematic sections present information about the travel agency's offerings, including "Our Offer," "About Us," "Destinations," and "Customer Reviews." Additionally, there is a reservation form allowing users to make online bookings. The project utilizes responsiveness through @media rules, ensuring optimal display on various device types. The entire project complies with the latest HTML5 and CSS3 standards.
